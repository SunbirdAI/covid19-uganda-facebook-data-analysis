22840,274577061337,"On this day, 09 August 2020 South African, SADC and African citizens are expected to celebrate Women's Day and I wonder how will this be possible when millions of women from Zimbabwe are victims of human rights. For anyone who is sane, has some conscious, morals, values, ethics, principles and would claim that there is justice when your neighbors are oppressed by a ruthless crocodile in our time, just through them out of the window. This is time for action for those who still have that moral compass within to stand up against the evil brutality of the ZANU-PF that has been claiming to be freedom fighters while they are busy abusing human rights of vulnerable members of our communities, women and children. People are dying of starvation while those in leadership especially in the SADC and AU would look the other side while beautiful flowers of Africa are becoming victims of these gruesome violent crimes by those in authority. Coming from the background of being oppressed by imperialist whites that came and raped African women and founding fathers decided to establish liberation movements to fight these evils not knowing that it will be the same liberators that will do what the apartheid government did to the poor African people. As we are about to heal from the injustices of the past, and getting involved in rebuilding the economies of Africa, one feels saddened by what we are subjected to see on the news. It is sad to see young women crossing rivers with children for survival during this pandemic 😷 when we would expect that those we elected will protect and defend us from such violations and social ills we face as human race. How does one sleep at night when you can see that there so much suffering with children from Zimbabwe created by men in 2020 for Pete' sake? The arrogance of these leaders instead of forging for peaceful ways in resolving crisis at hand makes one to wonder if it is not the right time to take part in these actions and take a stand to stop this nonsense. SADC should be looking at how a single currency can be introduced to mitigate the social ills that we face by ensuring that free trade becomes a practicality as envisaged by Agenda2063 goals. How will we meet these goals in our lifetime when we are led by wolves in sheep clothing? #IamAfrica #SADC_SAVE_ZIMBABWE #EachOneTeachOne #FightingForTheAfricaWeWant‬‬ #4IR #WeAreInThisTogether #StaySafe_StayHome #CoronavirusOutbreak #AfricaPrepares #FactsNotFear #AfCFTA #Reuters #Africa2020 #OneAfricanMarket #TheAfricaWeWant #AU #AfricaOnTheMove #InvestInAfrica #OneAfrica #African_Diaspora #MadeInAfrica #AfricaRising #Agenda2063",

Why we need to be vigilant and must hold them accountable. Does it mean that the poor people of Zimbabwe and SADC should wait for elections to hold these political leaders accountable when it is clear that they have abused their authority in collapsing their economies during this COVID19 era.

Share it to those who're sharing same sentiments. .... 👊🏾 ""We should be clear; the bailout was about saving the very rich and their institutions. We could have rescued the economy just fine without them. This gets me to the question that Carter poses at the end as to why the radicalism at the core of Keynes’s vision withered away after he died. Carter partially endorses Joan Robinson’s answer that Keynes was too naïve in believing good ideas could triumph on their own. While this is undoubtedly in part true, I would add a bit to this in saying that Keynes and his followers were not quite radical enough in their ideas. Specifically, they were too willing to accept the idea of a natural market, that is somehow pre-existing, but may require the intervention of the government to achieve both full employment and important public goals. This acceptance lends way too much legitimacy to the critiques posed by Hayek, Friedman, and other neo-liberal opponents of Keynesianism. The point is that the government structures the market in very fundamental ways. It can and does structure it differently through time in ways that have an enormous impact on the distribution of income.""

He calls meetings and commands his cult to abuse people after he pretends on social media to be a freedom fighter. Don't believe his smile. 3. Bobi betrayed his own brother Chameleon and he endorsed a different aspirant. He is a hypocrite. 4. Bobi thinks he is above everyone, he is soo proud. Let him fight his own battles if he is big 5. Bobi should stop forcing us to join his cult and riots 6. Bobi should stop forcing musicians to sing for him songs. 7. Bobi has a bad heart and if he insists on sending hooligans to abuse me, I will support NRM in retaliation. 8. He is Bobi and I am EDDY KENZO, he should not intimidate me. If I don't sing in Uganda I will sing in other countries 9. Do not trust Bobi because he has hidden evil motives to promote but disguises behind the word struggle. 10. Bobi indirectly uses the people close to his circle like Eddy Mutwe, Nubian, Peng, to promote hatred and wars because he can't post shit on his page therefore be vigilant on what those people post. 11. Bobi wine is evil, he changed since he joined politics. Ugandans should not trust him 12. I am going to start a war on Bobi Wine and I will win because my name is EDDY KENZO kaana ka mbaata. 13. I am not a politician so don't force me to join politics. Let me stick to music. 14. Stop paying media to call me gay, Illuminati, stop fighting my success because you fear competition. My carrier has come along way and you won't put me down. 15. Stop attacking Bebe Cool because he is a politician by blood. He was in politics before you. His family is full of politicians right from his grand parents. He has a right to what he says , your thoughts???",

26512,274577061337,"Hahaha ha.... ANDREW MWENDA JOINING BOBI WINE'S NUP / PEOPLE POWER FORMATION - NO NO NO NOOOO THAT IS FAKE NEWS!!!!!!! Critical reflections by Dr Vincent Magombe, Secretary Free Uganda (FU) Leadership Committee and Press Secretary FU - 07/08/2020 If it is not fake news, then one of these three things might be happening: 1. My journalist colleague Andrew Mwenda is oing what he does best- seeking to apply some crazy tactics to find out and understand for himself WHAT THIS PEOPLE POWER PHENOMENON and THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE BOBI WINE FACTOR IS. Not even the powerful Museveni intelligence and security forces have been able to work out and comprehend why Bobi Wine and his political formations have gained and continue to gain so much traction within the Ugandan populous. The best way to get that understanding for a clever and daring journalist, like Andrew Mwenda, is to get right inside the Bobi Wine inner circles and see for yourself how NUP / PEOPLE POWER look like from the inside. Unfortunately for Mwenda, merely joining the NUP / PEOPLE POWER MOVEMENT as a member night not be enough to expose him to the innermost sanctum of the political formations. Reason being that even Museveni's own intelligence and security apparatus has already poured and are still pouring into NUP / PEOPLE POWER MOVEMENT innumerable spies, but that has not led the regime to a better understanding of what makes these revolutionary movements tick. 2. If it is not the above, then one other possibility is that a usually hard-to convince Andrew Mwenda has, for once, become overwhelmed by the late realisation that what many first thought was a MERE GHETO JOKER is a REAL MAGICAL GHETO AND YOUNG GENERATION POLITICAL ATTRACTION, who can defy political odds TO SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACT AND KEEP THE MAJORITY YOUTH VOTE IN A UGANDAN NATION, WHERE THE YOUTHS ARE THE MAJORITY, something many other political leaders have failed to achieve. Remember that Andrew Mwenda has persistently urged that his close friend Museveni has always defeated the opposition parties by being able to attract the youth vote - whether through bribery, use of force or political charm. So perhaps Mwenda has now belatedly come to the realisation that Bobi Wine and his political formations have found the magical wand that eluded most other opposition leaders. There is no doubt that Dr Kizza Besigye for example attracted millions of Ugandan youths to his campaigns. As many Ugandans know, Dr Besigye even won the elections. But it seems that the youths who helped Besigye to win the elections, FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP THE VICTORY. With Bobi Wine and his NUP / PEOPLE POWER FORMATIONS, it is increasingly becoming a fact that over 90 percent of their struggle activism is premised on hardening the REVOLUTIONARY RESOLVE OF THE YOUNG FIGHTERS.... TRAINING AND EQUIPPING THEM THE NECESSARY VICTORY DEFENCE TACTICS AND STRATEGIES... As General Sejusa, the Chairman of Free Uganda (FU) recently observed, Bobi Wine is capable of winning the election, given the large youth following he has mastered in a very short period of his political activism. But what will make the difference is how the victorious youths fight to keep and maintain that victory. Of course, one way would be for Bobi Wine to maintain close links with any payriotic and progressive forces within the army and security services. But most critically, will be how the determined People Power Youthful Activists put up a campaign of street protests which are sustained for a period of several weeks, in spite of Museveni killings, bullets, tear gas and detention. That, according to General David Sejusa, would bring down the Museveni regime, as he cannot kill or arrest thousands of unarmed Ugandans without serious repercussions. We have seen this happen in Sudan, Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast, Gambia, even Zimbabwe. From the evidence we have so far seen of the happenings in the People Power Movement, it looks like these cohort of youth activists might be able to do exactly what General Sejusa is talking about. Something that has failed to materialise in the aftermath of past elections. So it is possible that even hard-to convince journalists and political analysts, like Andrew Mwenda, are coming to the realisation that this time round Museveni is facing much more formidable forces who could overwhelm his vote rigging enforcement machinery. 3. Lastly, but perhaps not realistic, is what some believe to be a SPYING MISSION, ON BEHALF OF MR YOW3RI MUSEVENI, BY JOURNALIST ANDREW MWENDA. This is not just most unlikely, but WOULD BE TOTALLY UNWISE IF IT WERE TRUE, as even Andrew Mwenda himself must know. SO YOU SPY FOR MUSEVENI THEN WHAT? Is Andrew Mwenda that stupid to risk all his professional career and hard-earned successes in the service of a man whose political journey will soon be over? If Andrew Mwenda were to engage in such a dangerous and unpopular venture, he must surely know that that would lead to serious consequences for his career (truncated)",

This time round Museveni will be facing off with millions of music-loving youths, who will be ideologically charged with Revolutionary messages, and any attempt by Museveni to rig the poll will be met with a defiance and determination never before seen in post-independent Uganda. If I were Museveni, I would save myself from embarrassment and humiliation by retiring with some grace and respect before election day. Failure to do that will lead to inevitable defeat by an embittered young generation, who will be ready to sacrifice all they have in the defense of their victory. Problem with Mzee Museveni is that he is not a good listener.... He is not a rational thinker.... He is addicted to election rigging - and he is bound to commit the worst mistake of his life - by trying to forcefully declare himself the winner, even when n it is more than obvious that he has lost badly. Mzee Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, please don't do it!!!!! This will not be business as usual. It will end very badly for you. Remember your very very powerful friends - Col Muamar Gadhafi of Egypt... Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe... Omar Al Bashir of Sudan... Hosni Mubarak of Egypt... Yahya Jammeh of Gambia... Laurent Gbagbo of Ivory Coast?????? MR MUSEVENI, DO YOU REMEMEMBER THEM????? WHERE ARE THEY? Mzee Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, do not say you were never warned. The Struggle Continues.",

33517,274577061337,"REMEMBERING FELA ANIKULAPO KUTI, THE BLACK PRESIDENT- RIP Fela died of an Aids-related illness TODAY in 1997, and it seems that every year since then his profile outside Africa has been steadily increasing. Barely a month goes by without new re-releases of his music. Fela’s music – or the Afrobeat genre that he founded – can be heard in lofts in fashionable Dalston in London or Williamsburg in New York, and current popular indie artists like Vampire Weekend, Franz Ferdinand and Damon Albarn have acknowledged a musical debt to him. Albarn has worked with Tony Allen, the original drummer in Fela’s Africa 70, who continues to release albums. Fela’s crossover to a mainstream Western audience was boosted by the musical Fela! which ran in London and Broadway in 2010. And now there’s a feature film – Finding Fela – directed by Academy Award-winner Alex Gibney, which is showing in a few cinemas in the US and rolls out in Europe and beyond in September. As a musician and social activist, he is increasingly being compared with Bob Marley. Since the early 1970s, Fela and his bands Africa 70 and, later, Egypt 80 built up an audience in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa. People were drawn to the revolutionary politics of his music, with songs like ITT (International Thief Thief), which attacked multinational corporations and Zombie, which parodied the mindless military types who unquestioningly followed orders. In the course of his life he was arrested more than 100 times, imprisoned, tortured and humiliated. Like Bob Marley, he was a man of the people, with a strong political agenda. But it was as a musical revolutionary that he became a talismanic figure for fellow artists. In Gibney’s film, Paul McCartney recounts how he saw Fela’s band when recording Band on the Run at the EMI’s Lagos studio in 1972. “They were the best band I’ve ever seen live” he said. “When Kuti and his band eventually really began to play, after a long, crazy build-up, I couldn’t stop weeping with joy.” FELA was one of the greatest men ever to come out of Africa. He invented a new musical genre and lived life on his own terms, as depicted in an eponymous Broadway which has successfully toured the globe. Bafta-winning director Steve McQueen worked on a film about his life. Fela deserves the attention. He was a giant. Born into a well-to-do family who sent him to the UK to study medicine in 1958, he chose instead to enrol at the Trinity College of Music. After returning to Nigeria in the late 60s, he created Afrobeat, blending African rhythms with jazz and funk. Fela's lyrics were scathing denunciations of Nigeria's socioeconomic reality. He focused on corruption, abuse of power, mental emancipation from colonialism and the need for Nigerians to stand up for their rights. He complained that when a pauper is caught stealing, he is labelled a thief and promptly jailed. But when a minister pockets millions from state coffers, it's explained away with fancy-sounding words to bamboozle the uneducated, like ""mismanagement"" and ""inquiry"". Fela never minced his words when criticising the government, referring to corrupt VIPs by name and christening them ""vagabonds in power"". There were consequences: harassment, imprisonment, beatings. But Fela said this only made him ""stronger"". Audaciously, he declared his sizable compound in Lagos an independent country, “ Kalakuta Republic”, complete with its own constitution and a free health clinic. Kalakuta offered sanctuary to the homeless while students trooped in to take part in debates on Africa's future. Marijuana, a key part of Fela's diet, flowed freely. Kalakuta was a libertarian's dream and a dictator's nightmare. In 1977, a thousand soldiers invaded the micro-republic, beating, raping and killing many of its inhabitants before razing it to the ground. Fela was almost beaten to death while his 77-year-old mother was thrown out of an upstairs window. She died soon after. But this didn't break Fela. After recovering from his injuries, he married 27 women in a single ceremony – saying they were jobless after Kalakuta's destruction so he would take care of them. Fela's marital arrangements and sexual politics continue to draw criticism – the mass wedding was followed by a mass divorce 10 years later, and Kuti often dismissed Aids and contraceptive protection as ""un-African"" – but at the time many Nigerians were enthralled by Fela's defiance. He went on to establish a political party, continued to lambast the authorities and suffered beatings and imprisonment. In 1979 he ran for presidency, but the military torpedoed his candidacy. Fela also criticised his countrymen for what he saw as their exaggerated reverence for authority and cowardice. ""My people are scared of the air around them, they always have an excuse not to fight for freedom,"" he sang. When men live in a system that does not even try to camouflage its injustice, they react by becoming radical or (truncated)",

34118,274577061337,"Civil Education to enlighten you on the Uganda Constitution that you should know TRIED NY BEST TRANSLATE FOR NON-LUGANDA SPEAKING: Civic Education you need to be enlightened. Uganda has had 4 constitutions. The first was in 1962 and we know it had some problems. This lead to the amended one of 1967 called the ""Pigeon Hole"" by Pres. Milton Obote. In 1971 came Pres. Amin who put a legal notice #1 which removed the constitution of 1967 and instituted his. ""Legal Notice"" is a letter that amends some articles in the constitution and adds that one wants but the people or citizens requesting or discussing. It's an individual's proposal or discussion nit citizens proposals or discussion and put it the legal notice and it comes law or becomes pat of the constitution. However, there were those that came with Pres. Lule coming from Tanzania. With him were Mr. Binaisa, and others also made an instrument of ""Legal Notice"" of 1970 remove one for 1971 and also removing one one for 1967. At that time there are some youth who noticed what the elders were doing at that tine and they copied. In the end, entered Luwero and entered the bush to restore the constitution and democracy. There were some youths who saw what the elder are doing and went to the bush in 1981 and won in 1986 and they brought brought ""Legal Notice"" of their own which said that the constitution of 1976 is illegal and placed a hold on the constitution of 1967 instituting an Electoral Commission which was like an electoral commission investigating the constitution of Pres. Milton Obote to see what needed to be amended in it. In the ""Legal Notice"" that Mr. Museveni instituted removed some articles like freedom of association, added Supreme Law of the Land is the President because there was no constitution All powera if the constitution of 1967 given to the President given to him for the next 4 years a period promising while the Electoral Comission investigated what needed to be amended. This was to restore the constitution and democracy. After 4 years the Commissions was not able to.do it's job and extended another 4 years which was his thing of extensions and lockdown. Then reaching 1994, in the Constitution Assembly came up with the fourth constitution of Uganda of 1995 and on the yeat on September 22nd is the date of that constitution although it went into law on October 8th, one day prior to independence day. When you look at a whole the problems that have brought wars, chaos originated from the fact that everyone wants to manipulate the constitution by force and the individuals assume the authority to ammends the constitution with the gun. The 1995 constitution current in force has its power given by the people and its that power that enforces government to run the affairs of the people by law or legally. It's the constitution that governs us. The constitution and i will call it the original constitution says if there is any one that tries to change the constitution commits treason. It continues to say that as a Ugandan you have to fight for.the constitution because if you do fight foe it that ""Power"" or authority can be take away from you by another in power and yet the power should have been yours through the vote. Nobody gave us that power except we the citizens and that led to the first elections in 1996 done after that constitution was enforced. In that constitution there were two important articles. The first one was based of past issues instituted term limits and secondly age limit ti prevent repeating the past mistakes and mean we have given ourselves the constitution and starting afresh in peace a New Uganda. In 2005, the leader himself who went in the bush to restore democracy and articles by touching the constitution or removing the term limits and people protest; however then ended up removing the term limits and we enterednintonthe next elections. However, there was an article that people though would withstand of age limit and people protested and still they removed this article as well. Now we are going in the scientific election. Before forget, we had TDA. Opposition put themselves in a group in the last elections of 2016. In which they places some conditions that if not met would not participate in the next coming elections. These conditions were not met and still the Opposition participated in the elections. Now this is happened again, the president has announced we are having a scientific election and the opposition is protesting but yet standing up candidates. There is a way the opposition connects in that when one does something everyone else follows or copies. In the process they find themselves whatever they are opposed to doing is the same they are doing. Because if you are opposed to doing something you can't be the same person participating in what you are opposed to means you agree with what's being done. The original construction of 1995 says ""you cannot change"" that anyone who changes the constitution commits (truncated)",

FREE UGANDA COMMUNIQUE ON UPDF RESHUFFLE BY MUSEVENI. issued by Dr Vincent Magombe, Secretary Free Uganda (FU) Leadership Committee and Press Secretary FU - 02/08/2020 Free Uganda (FU) welcomes the small changes which Dictator Museveni has just introduced in the Ugandan army, for example making a woman the UPDF Spokesperson. That is the result of the enormous pressure that is picking up on the regime from, among others, the comedy group BIZONTO. That said, changing the face, gender and tribe of the army spokesperson, or bringing in a few changes to seemingly redress the tribal balance of the top ranks of the Ugandan army is meaningless if the UPDF is going to remain Museveni""s personal army, meant to defend Museveni from his Ugandan political opponents, while unleashing savage brutality on innocent Ugandan masses. The Ugandan army, just like the Ugandan Police Service, should always operate as a People-centred national institution, which is not there to oppress and harass innocent Ugandan citizen in order to keep a dictatorial ruler in power against the wishes of the People. The UPDF, for one, has the specific role of defending the Ugandan nation from foreign enemies. It has no business and role to play in the electoral processes or the policing of peaceful protests against a much-hated ruler who has imposed himself on the People of Uganda, through rigged elections across three whole decades. As we all know, with Museveni forcefully hanging onto power and illegally occupying State House, the chances of building truly national and people-centred defence and security institutions are NIL!!!!!!!!

The Ugandan government has long been talking about banning secondhand items, to no avail. Uganda imports at least 1,500 tons of secondhand clothing annually from the United States alone, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission, though the U.K. and other nations also contribute. Called mivumba or mitumba, this clothing, courtesy of Western thrift stores, is worth more than $2 million and includes fast-fashion labels and high-end wear.
