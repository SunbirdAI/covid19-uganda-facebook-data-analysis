Every promotion in Public Service is a promotion to greater service. It calls for sacrifice, for diligence and a lot of hard work. We will yoke with the KCCA Political and Technical Leadership so that we can effectively deliver quality services to the citizens of Uganda. Kampala City is a home to all Ugandans. Kampala City is a home to millions of City dwellers from different walks of life, of different languages, and of different political leanings. But despite our diversity, the aspiration is one; the people of Uganda want a vibrant and attractive City. They want a City that they can proudly call their home. I congratulate and celebrate our predecessors for articulating the vision and the foundational work they have done in the Capital City since 2011. Laws have been established; systems and governance structures have been established. I thank you Hon Minister and your predecessors for providing guidance in this endeavor since inception. I thank Your Worship the Lord Mayor and the whole Council for the great work you have done in this regard as iron sharpens iron in your Council deliberations. I thank you Eng. Andrew Kitaka and the Management Team, for the service you have rendered to Kampala especially in the last twenty months. We will now together build on the foundation laid as we aspire to scale new heights to meet the aspirations of the people of Uganda. There is no doubt that the strong legacy established by my predecessor Dr Jennifer Semakula Musisi, will provide a solid foundation for the greater works yet to come.
