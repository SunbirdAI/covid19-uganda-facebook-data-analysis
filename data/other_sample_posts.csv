65801,"Ugandan kidnapped at Rwanda border, UPDF demands his return The Independent July 12, 2020 A Ugandan has been kidnapped by gunmen dressed in Rwandan army uniform in Kabale border district, witnesses have said. Levy Byomuhangi, a resident of Rugarama village in Nyinamuronzi ward, Katuna was kidnapped by gunmen dressed in Rwandan army uniform at Mushenyi village, Karuhanga parish, Rubaya Sub County, about 20 metres away from #Uganda-#Rwanda border. Lieutenant Colonel Robert Nahamya, the Uganda Peoples Defense Forces (UPDF) 19th Battalion Commander confirmed the incident, saying that Ugandan security officials have contacted their counterparts in Rwanda demanding for Byomuhangi’s release. “We have been told one Ugandan has been taken by the security forces in Rwanda. They were chasing smugglers and entered into Uganda, landed on one man and they have taken him. We have informed Rwandan authorities and are working hand in hand,” Nahamya said. Saime Twesigomwe, the Rubaya Sub County, LCIII Chairperson says that the security personnel crossed into Uganda while pursuing suspected smugglers but instead arrested Byomuhangi after failing to trace the smugglers. Twesigwomwe adds that Byomuhangi was heading home from Mushenyi village where he had spent the whole day burning charcoal. Twesigwome says that the victim was handcuffed and taken to Rwanda. Nelson Nshangabasheija, Katuna Town council LC3 Chairperson described the incident as unfortunate saying that Byomuhangi’s family is living in fear that he could be harmed. Many Ugandans have been arrested while others killed by Rwandan security personnel. Last month, Sydney, a resident of Kagogo village in Bigaga parish, Butanda Sub County, Kabale district was shot dead by Rwandan security accusing him of smuggling matchboxes in Sebeya village, Burera district, about 15 kilometres from the Uganda-Rwanda borderline. In April 2019, three farmers Susan Rwanjungu and Junensia Bazongoza, all residents of Mushenyi village and Jovia Ruvungafu, a resident of Nyinarushengye village in Katuna Town Council were arrested by armed Rwandan soldiers while digging in their gardens and taken into Rwanda. The Uganda-Rwanda border has been closed since February 2019 following a diplomatic row between the two countries. Rwandan officials including President Paul Kagame accused Uganda authorities of abducting its citizens and locking them up in un-gazetted areas as well as hosting, sponsoring and facilitating dissidents. Talks between the two countries are yet to yield positive results.",

66136,"Dear Sister Jane Ruth Aceng I was one of the doubting Thomases...I thought that this was an old photo brought around by your enemies to confuse Ugandans. Madam Minister,curse your PR office because if you where properly guided you would have just kept quite over this matter and make it look like the usual social media stories or if you considered it so important that you.should be heard the ministry PRO would have written a vague clarification full of nothing,we public communicators know how that is done. But for you with your own words to take yourself at the scene of crime is so implicating that in a civilised world you would have resigned Immediately....First of all it's a big mistake and a big blow to the fight against Covd19 for you to announce that you are joining elective politics. Uganada is not short of Women Politicians (MPs) instead Uganda is short of ethical medical proffessions. Whoever advised you to join the race for moreover a women affirmative seat is your number one enemy. Ugandans had embraced you as their chief Musawo whose face we the taxpayers pays to put on TV in an advert calling on Ugandans to respect the World Health Guidelines in order to fight Covd19. We more or less looked at you as our non partisan Country's Chief Medic. I know the character of Museveni and his people....they fear people who have a National appeal and endorsement and to kill it they trick and sets them up against society. This is exactly what is being done to you. You can even face a bigger embarrassment when they rig you out and you are made to look a fool before your very people. Still even when you win, yes we shall have another yellowgirl in Parliament but ""our Doctor Ruth Aceng"" would have been murdered. I feel so sad that your effort to keep Ugandans health in this so challenging time has been dragged in the mud and wasted. Now you're like anyother selfish Nrm Politician. Of course one can argue that you are out to serve society. Others will challenge me of exhibiting double standards for me to continue being a Member of Parliament and then discourage others. My answer is that basing on where am ,I know better the situation in here. I wish to inform you that there are lots of other ways to make a difference and have a fulfilling job in politics. Whether that’s in a political party, the private sector, consultancies or NGOs. The fact is that not all of us can be in elective politics and as a Country we should be able to preserve a few souls to occupy offices that need a unifying character. From your Honourable Sister.
