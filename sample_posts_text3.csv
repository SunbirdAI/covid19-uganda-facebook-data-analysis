22840,274577061337,"On this day, 09 August 2020 South African, SADC and African citizens are expected to celebrate Women's Day and I wonder how will this be possible when millions of women from Zimbabwe are victims of human rights. For anyone who is sane, has some conscious, morals, values, ethics, principles and would claim that there is justice when your neighbors are oppressed by a ruthless crocodile in our time, just through them out of the window. This is time for action for those who still have that moral compass within to stand up against the evil brutality of the ZANU-PF that has been claiming to be freedom fighters while they are busy abusing human rights of vulnerable members of our communities, women and children. People are dying of starvation while those in leadership especially in the SADC and AU would look the other side while beautiful flowers of Africa are becoming victims of these gruesome violent crimes by those in authority. Coming from the background of being oppressed by imperialist whites that came and raped African women and founding fathers decided to establish liberation movements to fight these evils not knowing that it will be the same liberators that will do what the apartheid government did to the poor African people. As we are about to heal from the injustices of the past, and getting involved in rebuilding the economies of Africa, one feels saddened by what we are subjected to see on the news. It is sad to see young women crossing rivers with children for survival during this pandemic 😷 when we would expect that those we elected will protect and defend us from such violations and social ills we face as human race. How does one sleep at night when you can see that there so much suffering with children from Zimbabwe created by men in 2020 for Pete' sake? The arrogance of these leaders instead of forging for peaceful ways in resolving crisis at hand makes one to wonder if it is not the right time to take part in these actions and take a stand to stop this nonsense. SADC should be looking at how a single currency can be introduced to mitigate the social ills that we face by ensuring that free trade becomes a practicality as envisaged by Agenda2063 goals. How will we meet these goals in our lifetime when we are led by wolves in sheep clothing? #IamAfrica #SADC_SAVE_ZIMBABWE #EachOneTeachOne #FightingForTheAfricaWeWant‬‬ #4IR #WeAreInThisTogether #StaySafe_StayHome #CoronavirusOutbreak #AfricaPrepares #FactsNotFear #AfCFTA #Reuters #Africa2020 #OneAfricanMarket #TheAfricaWeWant #AU #AfricaOnTheMove #InvestInAfrica #OneAfrica #African_Diaspora #MadeInAfrica #AfricaRising #Agenda2063",

Why we need to be vigilant and must hold them accountable. Does it mean that the poor people of Zimbabwe and SADC should wait for elections to hold these political leaders accountable when it is clear that they have abused their authority in collapsing their economies during this COVID19 era.

Share it to those who're sharing same sentiments. .... 👊🏾 ""We should be clear; the bailout was about saving the very rich and their institutions. We could have rescued the economy just fine without them. This gets me to the question that Carter poses at the end as to why the radicalism at the core of Keynes’s vision withered away after he died. Carter partially endorses Joan Robinson’s answer that Keynes was too naïve in believing good ideas could triumph on their own. While this is undoubtedly in part true, I would add a bit to this in saying that Keynes and his followers were not quite radical enough in their ideas. Specifically, they were too willing to accept the idea of a natural market, that is somehow pre-existing, but may require the intervention of the government to achieve both full employment and important public goals. This acceptance lends way too much legitimacy to the critiques posed by Hayek, Friedman, and other neo-liberal opponents of Keynesianism. The point is that the government structures the market in very fundamental ways. It can and does structure it differently through time in ways that have an enormous impact on the distribution of income.""

He calls meetings and commands his cult to abuse people after he pretends on social media to be a freedom fighter. Don't believe his smile. 3. Bobi betrayed his own brother Chameleon and he endorsed a different aspirant. He is a hypocrite. 4. Bobi thinks he is above everyone, he is soo proud. Let him fight his own battles if he is big 5. Bobi should stop forcing us to join his cult and riots 6. Bobi should stop forcing musicians to sing for him songs. 7. Bobi has a bad heart and if he insists on sending hooligans to abuse me, I will support NRM in retaliation. 8. He is Bobi and I am EDDY KENZO, he should not intimidate me. If I don't sing in Uganda I will sing in other countries 9. Do not trust Bobi because he has hidden evil motives to promote but disguises behind the word struggle. 10. Bobi indirectly uses the people close to his circle like Eddy Mutwe, Nubian, Peng, to promote hatred and wars because he can't post shit on his page therefore be vigilant on what those people post. 11. Bobi wine is evil, he changed since he joined politics. Ugandans should not trust him 12. I am going to start a war on Bobi Wine and I will win because my name is EDDY KENZO kaana ka mbaata. 13. I am not a politician so don't force me to join politics. Let me stick to music. 14. Stop paying media to call me gay, Illuminati, stop fighting my success because you fear competition. My carrier has come along way and you won't put me down. 15. Stop attacking Bebe Cool because he is a politician by blood. He was in politics before you. His family is full of politicians right from his grand parents. He has a right to what he says , your thoughts???",

26512,274577061337,"Hahaha ha.... ANDREW MWENDA JOINING BOBI WINE'S NUP / PEOPLE POWER FORMATION - NO NO NO NOOOO THAT IS FAKE NEWS!!!!!!! Critical reflections by Dr Vincent Magombe, Secretary Free Uganda (FU) Leadership Committee and Press Secretary FU - 07/08/2020 If it is not fake news, then one of these three things might be happening: 1. My journalist colleague Andrew Mwenda is oing what he does best- seeking to apply some crazy tactics to find out and understand for himself WHAT THIS PEOPLE POWER PHENOMENON and THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE BOBI WINE FACTOR IS. Not even the powerful Museveni intelligence and security forces have been able to work out and comprehend why Bobi Wine and his political formations have gained and continue to gain so much traction within the Ugandan populous. The best way to get that understanding for a clever and daring journalist, like Andrew Mwenda, is to get right inside the Bobi Wine inner circles and see for yourself how NUP / PEOPLE POWER look like from the inside. Unfortunately for Mwenda, merely joining the NUP / PEOPLE POWER MOVEMENT as a member night not be enough to expose him to the innermost sanctum of the political formations. Reason being that even Museveni's own intelligence and security apparatus has already poured and are still pouring into NUP / PEOPLE POWER MOVEMENT innumerable spies, but that has not led the regime to a better understanding of what makes these revolutionary movements tick. 2. If it is not the above, then one other possibility is that a usually hard-to convince Andrew Mwenda has, for once, become overwhelmed by the late realisation that what many first thought was a MERE GHETO JOKER is a REAL MAGICAL GHETO AND YOUNG GENERATION POLITICAL ATTRACTION, who can defy political odds TO SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACT AND KEEP THE MAJORITY YOUTH VOTE IN A UGANDAN NATION, WHERE THE YOUTHS ARE THE MAJORITY, something many other political leaders have failed to achieve. Remember that Andrew Mwenda has persistently urged that his close friend Museveni has always defeated the opposition parties by being able to attract the youth vote - whether through bribery, use of force or political charm. So perhaps Mwenda has now belatedly come to the realisation that Bobi Wine and his political formations have found the magical wand that eluded most other opposition leaders. There is no doubt that Dr Kizza Besigye for example attracted millions of Ugandan youths to his campaigns. As many Ugandans know, Dr Besigye even won the elections. But it seems that the youths who helped Besigye to win the elections, FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP THE VICTORY. With Bobi Wine and his NUP / PEOPLE POWER FORMATIONS, it is increasingly becoming a fact that over 90 percent of their struggle activism is premised on hardening the REVOLUTIONARY RESOLVE OF THE YOUNG FIGHTERS.... TRAINING AND EQUIPPING THEM THE NECESSARY VICTORY DEFENCE TACTICS AND STRATEGIES... As General Sejusa, the Chairman of Free Uganda (FU) recently observed, Bobi Wine is capable of winning the election, given the large youth following he has mastered in a very short period of his political activism. But what will make the difference is how the victorious youths fight to keep and maintain that victory. Of course, one way would be for Bobi Wine to maintain close links with any payriotic and progressive forces within the army and security services. But most critically, will be how the determined People Power Youthful Activists put up a campaign of street protests which are sustained for a period of several weeks, in spite of Museveni killings, bullets, tear gas and detention. That, according to General David Sejusa, would bring down the Museveni regime, as he cannot kill or arrest thousands of unarmed Ugandans without serious repercussions. We have seen this happen in Sudan, Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast, Gambia, even Zimbabwe. From the evidence we have so far seen of the happenings in the People Power Movement, it looks like these cohort of youth activists might be able to do exactly what General Sejusa is talking about. Something that has failed to materialise in the aftermath of past elections. So it is possible that even hard-to convince journalists and political analysts, like Andrew Mwenda, are coming to the realisation that this time round Museveni is facing much more formidable forces who could overwhelm his vote rigging enforcement machinery. 3. Lastly, but perhaps not realistic, is what some believe to be a SPYING MISSION, ON BEHALF OF MR YOW3RI MUSEVENI, BY JOURNALIST ANDREW MWENDA. This is not just most unlikely, but WOULD BE TOTALLY UNWISE IF IT WERE TRUE, as even Andrew Mwenda himself must know. SO YOU SPY FOR MUSEVENI THEN WHAT? Is Andrew Mwenda that stupid to risk all his professional career and hard-earned successes in the service of a man whose political journey will soon be over? If Andrew Mwenda were to engage in such a dangerous and unpopular venture, he must surely know that that would lead to serious consequences for his career (truncated)",

This time round Museveni will be facing off with millions of music-loving youths, who will be ideologically charged with Revolutionary messages, and any attempt by Museveni to rig the poll will be met with a defiance and determination never before seen in post-independent Uganda. If I were Museveni, I would save myself from embarrassment and humiliation by retiring with some grace and respect before election day. Failure to do that will lead to inevitable defeat by an embittered young generation, who will be ready to sacrifice all they have in the defense of their victory. Problem with Mzee Museveni is that he is not a good listener.... He is not a rational thinker.... He is addicted to election rigging - and he is bound to commit the worst mistake of his life - by trying to forcefully declare himself the winner, even when n it is more than obvious that he has lost badly. Mzee Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, please don't do it!!!!! This will not be business as usual. It will end very badly for you. Remember your very very powerful friends - Col Muamar Gadhafi of Egypt... Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe... Omar Al Bashir of Sudan... Hosni Mubarak of Egypt... Yahya Jammeh of Gambia... Laurent Gbagbo of Ivory Coast?????? MR MUSEVENI, DO YOU REMEMEMBER THEM????? WHERE ARE THEY? Mzee Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, do not say you were never warned. The Struggle Continues.",

33517,274577061337,"REMEMBERING FELA ANIKULAPO KUTI, THE BLACK PRESIDENT- RIP Fela died of an Aids-related illness TODAY in 1997, and it seems that every year since then his profile outside Africa has been steadily increasing. Barely a month goes by without new re-releases of his music. Fela’s music – or the Afrobeat genre that he founded – can be heard in lofts in fashionable Dalston in London or Williamsburg in New York, and current popular indie artists like Vampire Weekend, Franz Ferdinand and Damon Albarn have acknowledged a musical debt to him. Albarn has worked with Tony Allen, the original drummer in Fela’s Africa 70, who continues to release albums. Fela’s crossover to a mainstream Western audience was boosted by the musical Fela! which ran in London and Broadway in 2010. And now there’s a feature film – Finding Fela – directed by Academy Award-winner Alex Gibney, which is showing in a few cinemas in the US and rolls out in Europe and beyond in September. As a musician and social activist, he is increasingly being compared with Bob Marley. Since the early 1970s, Fela and his bands Africa 70 and, later, Egypt 80 built up an audience in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa. People were drawn to the revolutionary politics of his music, with songs like ITT (International Thief Thief), which attacked multinational corporations and Zombie, which parodied the mindless military types who unquestioningly followed orders. In the course of his life he was arrested more than 100 times, imprisoned, tortured and humiliated. Like Bob Marley, he was a man of the people, with a strong political agenda. But it was as a musical revolutionary that he became a talismanic figure for fellow artists. In Gibney’s film, Paul McCartney recounts how he saw Fela’s band when recording Band on the Run at the EMI’s Lagos studio in 1972. “They were the best band I’ve ever seen live” he said. “When Kuti and his band eventually really began to play, after a long, crazy build-up, I couldn’t stop weeping with joy.” FELA was one of the greatest men ever to come out of Africa. He invented a new musical genre and lived life on his own terms, as depicted in an eponymous Broadway which has successfully toured the globe. Bafta-winning director Steve McQueen worked on a film about his life. Fela deserves the attention. He was a giant. Born into a well-to-do family who sent him to the UK to study medicine in 1958, he chose instead to enrol at the Trinity College of Music. After returning to Nigeria in the late 60s, he created Afrobeat, blending African rhythms with jazz and funk. Fela's lyrics were scathing denunciations of Nigeria's socioeconomic reality. He focused on corruption, abuse of power, mental emancipation from colonialism and the need for Nigerians to stand up for their rights. He complained that when a pauper is caught stealing, he is labelled a thief and promptly jailed. But when a minister pockets millions from state coffers, it's explained away with fancy-sounding words to bamboozle the uneducated, like ""mismanagement"" and ""inquiry"". Fela never minced his words when criticising the government, referring to corrupt VIPs by name and christening them ""vagabonds in power"". There were consequences: harassment, imprisonment, beatings. But Fela said this only made him ""stronger"". Audaciously, he declared his sizable compound in Lagos an independent country, “ Kalakuta Republic”, complete with its own constitution and a free health clinic. Kalakuta offered sanctuary to the homeless while students trooped in to take part in debates on Africa's future. Marijuana, a key part of Fela's diet, flowed freely. Kalakuta was a libertarian's dream and a dictator's nightmare. In 1977, a thousand soldiers invaded the micro-republic, beating, raping and killing many of its inhabitants before razing it to the ground. Fela was almost beaten to death while his 77-year-old mother was thrown out of an upstairs window. She died soon after. But this didn't break Fela. After recovering from his injuries, he married 27 women in a single ceremony – saying they were jobless after Kalakuta's destruction so he would take care of them. Fela's marital arrangements and sexual politics continue to draw criticism – the mass wedding was followed by a mass divorce 10 years later, and Kuti often dismissed Aids and contraceptive protection as ""un-African"" – but at the time many Nigerians were enthralled by Fela's defiance. He went on to establish a political party, continued to lambast the authorities and suffered beatings and imprisonment. In 1979 he ran for presidency, but the military torpedoed his candidacy. Fela also criticised his countrymen for what he saw as their exaggerated reverence for authority and cowardice. ""My people are scared of the air around them, they always have an excuse not to fight for freedom,"" he sang. When men live in a system that does not even try to camouflage its injustice, they react by becoming radical or (truncated)",

34118,274577061337,"Civil Education to enlighten you on the Uganda Constitution that you should know TRIED NY BEST TRANSLATE FOR NON-LUGANDA SPEAKING: Civic Education you need to be enlightened. Uganda has had 4 constitutions. The first was in 1962 and we know it had some problems. This lead to the amended one of 1967 called the ""Pigeon Hole"" by Pres. Milton Obote. In 1971 came Pres. Amin who put a legal notice #1 which removed the constitution of 1967 and instituted his. ""Legal Notice"" is a letter that amends some articles in the constitution and adds that one wants but the people or citizens requesting or discussing. It's an individual's proposal or discussion nit citizens proposals or discussion and put it the legal notice and it comes law or becomes pat of the constitution. However, there were those that came with Pres. Lule coming from Tanzania. With him were Mr. Binaisa, and others also made an instrument of ""Legal Notice"" of 1970 remove one for 1971 and also removing one one for 1967. At that time there are some youth who noticed what the elders were doing at that tine and they copied. In the end, entered Luwero and entered the bush to restore the constitution and democracy. There were some youths who saw what the elder are doing and went to the bush in 1981 and won in 1986 and they brought brought ""Legal Notice"" of their own which said that the constitution of 1976 is illegal and placed a hold on the constitution of 1967 instituting an Electoral Commission which was like an electoral commission investigating the constitution of Pres. Milton Obote to see what needed to be amended in it. In the ""Legal Notice"" that Mr. Museveni instituted removed some articles like freedom of association, added Supreme Law of the Land is the President because there was no constitution All powera if the constitution of 1967 given to the President given to him for the next 4 years a period promising while the Electoral Comission investigated what needed to be amended. This was to restore the constitution and democracy. After 4 years the Commissions was not able to.do it's job and extended another 4 years which was his thing of extensions and lockdown. Then reaching 1994, in the Constitution Assembly came up with the fourth constitution of Uganda of 1995 and on the yeat on September 22nd is the date of that constitution although it went into law on October 8th, one day prior to independence day. When you look at a whole the problems that have brought wars, chaos originated from the fact that everyone wants to manipulate the constitution by force and the individuals assume the authority to ammends the constitution with the gun. The 1995 constitution current in force has its power given by the people and its that power that enforces government to run the affairs of the people by law or legally. It's the constitution that governs us. The constitution and i will call it the original constitution says if there is any one that tries to change the constitution commits treason. It continues to say that as a Ugandan you have to fight for.the constitution because if you do fight foe it that ""Power"" or authority can be take away from you by another in power and yet the power should have been yours through the vote. Nobody gave us that power except we the citizens and that led to the first elections in 1996 done after that constitution was enforced. In that constitution there were two important articles. The first one was based of past issues instituted term limits and secondly age limit ti prevent repeating the past mistakes and mean we have given ourselves the constitution and starting afresh in peace a New Uganda. In 2005, the leader himself who went in the bush to restore democracy and articles by touching the constitution or removing the term limits and people protest; however then ended up removing the term limits and we enterednintonthe next elections. However, there was an article that people though would withstand of age limit and people protested and still they removed this article as well. Now we are going in the scientific election. Before forget, we had TDA. Opposition put themselves in a group in the last elections of 2016. In which they places some conditions that if not met would not participate in the next coming elections. These conditions were not met and still the Opposition participated in the elections. Now this is happened again, the president has announced we are having a scientific election and the opposition is protesting but yet standing up candidates. There is a way the opposition connects in that when one does something everyone else follows or copies. In the process they find themselves whatever they are opposed to doing is the same they are doing. Because if you are opposed to doing something you can't be the same person participating in what you are opposed to means you agree with what's being done. The original construction of 1995 says ""you cannot change"" that anyone who changes the constitution commits (truncated)",

FREE UGANDA COMMUNIQUE ON UPDF RESHUFFLE BY MUSEVENI. issued by Dr Vincent Magombe, Secretary Free Uganda (FU) Leadership Committee and Press Secretary FU - 02/08/2020 Free Uganda (FU) welcomes the small changes which Dictator Museveni has just introduced in the Ugandan army, for example making a woman the UPDF Spokesperson. That is the result of the enormous pressure that is picking up on the regime from, among others, the comedy group BIZONTO. That said, changing the face, gender and tribe of the army spokesperson, or bringing in a few changes to seemingly redress the tribal balance of the top ranks of the Ugandan army is meaningless if the UPDF is going to remain Museveni""s personal army, meant to defend Museveni from his Ugandan political opponents, while unleashing savage brutality on innocent Ugandan masses. The Ugandan army, just like the Ugandan Police Service, should always operate as a People-centred national institution, which is not there to oppress and harass innocent Ugandan citizen in order to keep a dictatorial ruler in power against the wishes of the People. The UPDF, for one, has the specific role of defending the Ugandan nation from foreign enemies. It has no business and role to play in the electoral processes or the policing of peaceful protests against a much-hated ruler who has imposed himself on the People of Uganda, through rigged elections across three whole decades. As we all know, with Museveni forcefully hanging onto power and illegally occupying State House, the chances of building truly national and people-centred defence and security institutions are NIL!!!!!!!!

The Ugandan government has long been talking about banning secondhand items, to no avail. Uganda imports at least 1,500 tons of secondhand clothing annually from the United States alone, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission, though the U.K. and other nations also contribute. Called mivumba or mitumba, this clothing, courtesy of Western thrift stores, is worth more than $2 million and includes fast-fashion labels and high-end wear.

39102,641376452558640,"Before his death in 2013, Chinua Achebe (Nigeria) published a memoir titled *There Was a Country *(Allen Lane, 2012) that substantively dealt with the Biafra War which took place between 6 Jul 1967 – 15 Jan 1970. Achebe came from the Igbo community which was primarily associated with the disastrous succession attempt. The famed poet Christopher Okigo, another Igbo intellectual, died in the conflict. The Biafra war continues to be an emotive and divisive topic in Africa’s most populous nation. So populous is Nigeria, in fact, that certain communities - such as the Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa - outnumber the populations of many countries. In a public lecture, Kenyan author Ngũgi wa Thiong’o famously pondered: ‘**How are 300,000 Icelanders a nation, but 40 million Yoruba are tribesmen?’** Chinua Achebe’s ascent to the pinnacle of Nigerian literature began with the publication of his first novel, *Things Fall Apart *(Heinemann, 1958). The book, about pre-colonial life in south-eastern Nigeria and the arrival of the Europeans, has become a classic, selling over 10 million copies and being translated into over 50 languages. It was included in *Time* magazine’s list of *TIME 100 Best English-language Novels From 1923 – 2005*. Achebe’s other novels include *No Longer at Ease* (1960), *Arrow of God* (1964), *A Man of the People* (1966) and *Anthills of the Savannah* (1987).

I am a secondary school teacher from the Northwest Region of Cameroon. The Anglophone Crisis started in late 2016 after the English-speaking lawyers and teachers in the two English-speaking regions of Cameroon, Northwest and Southwest Regions, respectively demanded for adjustments in the judicial system and educational system. It has now resulted to an armed conflict with the leaders demanding for independence. So many things have gone wrong. Many lives have been lost. Many houses have been burnt to the ground. Many people have been displaced; internally while some are refugees in Nigeria. Many businesses have crumbled and schools are not effective in these two regions, to name but a few. The Government and the International Community have so far made some efforts to resolve the crisis but there has been little progress. I think that at this point, it is no longer ‘Let the Government handle it’ or ‘Let those who started the crisis handle it’ or ‘Let the International Community handle it’ or ‘The Leaders know what to do’ or ‘The Leaders are not open-minded’. I think that everyone has to come in now, including You. A positive contribution from you on how this crisis could be resolved will be greatly appreciated. Please join the Movement to resolve the Anglophone Crisis through the link or you send your positive contributions to humbleperspectives2020@gmail.com or +237670455448 Thank you for your time and consideration and we look forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely, Aye Brandon Kiven Northwest Region, Cameroon",

42167,1486116641609917,"Leading an African country is a difficult job but very rewarding when you see results. Africa suffers with transformation inertia, impacted a historical unfair geopolitical setup. In such a setting, when you have a leader setting a great example and willing to sacrifice and go all the way to change the storyline, as a voter you must not let go of that leader. Therefore, choosing Museveni is an easy decision to make. His credentials speak for themselves. Fortunately, within NRM, this point is very clear, which is why he is unopposed for both posts-National Chairman and Presidential flagbearer 2021. I must thank the NRM fraternity for the firm trust and confidence expressed in his leadership and Vision for the country. It is not for absence of alternative talent; rather it is that Museveni’s capabilities are so noticeably superior that there is no need pulling our hair out just to prove that we are democratic. We are democratic and harmonious, and it is not everybody that can be president at the end of the day. We have our able captain, our sharpshooter; we don’t need to substitute him. Museveni, the man, first offered to lead NRM, as a civil corporate political organization in 2005 when multiparty politics was reintroduced. He has since worked for, earned and enjoyed unrivaled popularity within the party, and led it to victory in three consecutive general elections and innumerable bi-elections at lower levels. #Museveni2021 #ONCKyambogo",

This young lady, a Munyankole by birth, is a shining example of what a Patriotic Ugandan should be like. She hates what Museveni and the savage security gangs are doing, which is making Ugandans hate each other. She calls on Museveni to immediately stop inciting violence and igniting hatred against the People of Ankole and Western Uganda. Young pro-democracy activists from Ankole are now leading the Struggle for Freedom. They are telling Museveni to stop playing the tribal card. They want Museveni to listen to the increasing voices of reason, such as those of Bizinto Comedians, who have been arrested for calling out Museveni's tribalistic tendencies. They want Museveni to immediately free Bizonto artists and all other innocent pro-democracy activists who have been incarcerated and are now being subjected to torture and harassment from evil-minded Museveni militias. Will Museveni listen to this young lady and other Ugandans crying out for freedom? I doubt. I believe that Museveni is so drunk and addicted to power after 34 years of his despotic rule that he will try his best to quell the approachibg People's revolution. This time round, however, all signs are pointing toast resounding defeat for his dictatorial regime and a dramatic collapse of reign over Uganda. The Struggle Continues",

Soon after illegally conquering Uganda and establishing a Rwandan regime of occupation, blood soaked Rwandan killer Kayibanda Rubatarasirwa Museveni set about exterminating the people of Northern Uganda. Supported by henchmen like Tinyefunza, Mugisha Muntu, Severino Kahinda Otafire, Kale Kayihura, and quislings like Ofwono Opondo, Kayibanda embarked on a holocaust of unprecedented barbarity never seen on the African continent before and dwarfing the 1966-67 holocaust in Nigeria. For 20 years, Kayibanda corralled and imprisoned the people of Northern Uganda in dreadful concentration camps that NAZI Fuhrer Adolf Hitler would have been jealous of. The brutal and the cruel manner in which Kayibanda and his killer army set upon people they regarded as biological substances has never been repeated anywhere on earth. Rape of minors became routine, homosexual rape of men, some as old as 90 years, became a common occurrence. Human Rights Watch estimated that up to 1,000 Acholi were dying in these killer camps every week, yet the world sat by and watched. It is estimated that up to 1 million Acholi were killed by Kayibanda and his murderous merry band. This was also the first time on the African continent that a gang of heavily armed killers marched from their homeland in Rwanda, travelling thousands of miles, to murder people in a neighbouring country who had done them no harm, but had on the contrary provided them with refuge when they were fleeing genocide in their own country. Kayibanda and his murderous merry gang have since been trying to bury their blood soaked record. Employing bus boys like Julius Peter Moto, they issue out unending drivel in which they blame their victims for their suffering. But the fact remains that Kayibanda and his hired killers, including Ugandan quislings who aided and abetted his murderous rampages then and now, have never been punished. Some of them have taken off their uniforms and now hide as false messiahs in the general population. They have forgotten that blood spilled can never be erased.

Now when a whole ministry of education say that ICT must be optional then it symbolizes a country in a criss or people who are trying to resist change, probably strategically weak at adjusting development scenarios.

Our people are fooled to master foreign languages of which one requires a Visa to go to where they originated from. Just imagine that even the British embasy had to flee to a far destination. My speaking and writing of the English language must not come at the expense of a mother language and it doesn't matter which language as long as it's an indigenous one within Africa. Lastly, just imagine those parents who secretly punish their little ones for speaking vanarcular in the homes and I think these are the people we need to convince that our endogeneous knowledge, local languages are superior or equal to those of our colonizers. The time is now to resist any foreign witchcraft. How on earth one can make Chinese and swahili mandatory but ignore Luganda one of the most popular languages in the region? Last time I saw the Chinese chasing away Africans for bringing disease and what are you going to do with this language? How comes we didn't learn Japanese or Germanish another influential industrial powers? By putting into account of the Sino-African relations, I think all is not rosy in these economic and diplomatic ties. I think we have reduced ourselves too far to learn a culture that's a little of no different from the west.",

48058,274577061337,"PHANEROO~DEVOTION Saturday, 25th July 2020 Apostle Grace Lubega Hosea 10:13(KJV); Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men. BY KNOWLEDGE WE WAR Deception is the mother of all iniquity. If you look around this present world, at the shocking attacks of brother against brother amplified through the media, at the pain and suffering of the innocent and at the general plight of mankind, understand that it all stems from deception. The devil is not called the father of lies for no reason. If anything, his greatest weapon against humanity is not poverty, disease, hatred or evil in all its forms, his greatest weapon is the ignorance of men. When you truly understand this child of God, you will start to value revelational knowledge like your life depends on it because it does. The devil is not intimidated by men who can call down fire from heaven, men who fast or even by ""mighty prayer warriors."" Think about this for a moment; after forty days of prayer and fasting, guess who came slithering into Christ's path--the devil himself. One would have thought that forty days of prayer and fasting would have kept him at bay. Did they? No. How did Christ deal with his unwelcome visitor? Did He call down fire from heaven? He had the ability to but did not do so. Did He command legions of angels to come get rid of the interloper? He could have done so but He did not. What Christ did was to send the devil away with the Word (Luke 4). The present world suffers from a malignant state of deception and it is by this deception that the enemy keeps the sons of men in miserable states and vicious cycles of suffering. You are not supposed to be in the enemy's pool of victims. Paul says that you are not ignorant of the devil's devices (2 Corinthians 2:11). You have an unction from on high and know all things!(1 John 2:20). You have the Holy Ghost who desires to teach you all things(John 14:26). Child of God, value knowledge! Court it, seek it and pursue it. You cannot afford to be like the deceived of this world when God has given you a manual against deception. Dive into the Word with this consciousness and understanding. FURTHER STUDY: 2 Corinthians 2:11, 1 John 2:20 GOLDEN NUGGET: Child of God, value knowledge! Court it, seek it and pursue it. You cannot afford to be like the deceived of this world when God has given you a manual against deception. Dive into the Word with this consciousness and understanding. PRAYER: Father, I thank You for this Word. My heart and soul delight in knowledge. Wisdom is my sister and understanding is my kinswoman. I can never be a victim of deception because Your Word is my constant light. In Jesus' name, Amen.

This is what you see on his Facebook Profile: Studies at University of Oxford Studied at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem Studied at Harvard Law School Studied Law at Makerere University Studied at Law Development Centre I hasten to add that the greatest credibility of these youths, now poised to assume the political leadership of the Ugandan nation, is their rootedness in, understanding of and readiness to uplift and transform the dire situation and living experience of the majority of Ugandans, who live at the margins of society - in the poverty-stricken city and town Ghettos and the forgotten villages in the Ugandan countryside. And there in lies their strength and source pf popularity.... Mr. Yoweri Museveni, who has misruled and destroyed the political and socio-economic fabric of the Ugandan nation, knows and understands the serious threat that these youths pose to his outmoded and increasingly despised NRM dictatorship, and that is why he is putting all his hopes in the violent repression and suppression of the populous who are showing real signs of abandoning the NRM and switching to more progressive revolutionary forces led by the likes of Bobi Wine and David Lewis Lubongowa.

51173,1681786142107330,"Uganda has registered its first coronavirus death, the country's health ministry has announced. This was revealed on Thursday by the Director General Health services, Dr Henry Mwebesa. ""A 34 year old Ugandan female,resident of Namisindwa District who presented with COVID like signs and symptoms: fever,dry cough,headache and difficulty in breathing,"" Mwebesa said at a press briefing. He added, ""The postmortem samples from the deceased were confirmed positive for SARS-COV-2 by 4 laboratories: UVRI, CPHL, Tororo and Makerere. In addition, findings at postmortem showed features of acute pneumonia; findings that are consistent with COVID-19 infection. In our earlier report we had indicated that the deceased was not a Ugandan. Further investigations have since established that she was a Ugandan from Manafwa, Bubulo East, Namabya- Namunyali- Sisongofwa."" Namisindwa District is bordered by Bududa District to the north, Kenya to the east and south, Tororo District to the south-west, and Manafwa District to the west. The current interventions are aimed at limiting and controlling secondary transmissions arising out of this case-patient. In addition to Lwakhaha (average daily crossing 150-180 ) as a major border point, there are a lot of illegal border crossings between Uganda and Kenya. To date, Uganda has registered 1,079 cumulative confirmed cases of Ugandans and a total of 971 Ugandan recoveries. #STAYSAFEUG",

How can we be sure that the data collected will not be misused by unscrupulous persons pretending to be boda boda.

The plea to the courts should be on account of endangering the security of citizens and the potential data protection flaws. Just a thought. The Struggle Continues,

They have been shooting down, firing teargas and rounding up People Power activists. This is State terrorism aimed at curtailing the growing popularity of Bobi Wine and his People Power Movement. Innocent unarmed youths are being shot at and brutalised by Museveni's terror gangs. So far the consensus within the People Power Movement has to use peaceful means without recourse to violence. But as Uganda's history has shown, whenever a government in power crosses the line and blatantly terrorises the People, violent struggle has become the way forward. The situation in Uganda under Dictator Museveni is quickly becoming worse than the worst days of Idi Amin's rule. And if this continues, Ugandans will no doubt rethink the strategies of bringing down the Dictatorial regime. The Struggle continues",

The other powerful officials that have been fired along with Rwakojo include IT Director Namugera Pontius (also head technical support services), Director Finance & Administrator Joseph Lwanga, Data Department’s Edgar Kasigwa, Jordan Lubega (Administrator networks), Musuza Charles (from data section) and Godfrey Wanyoto who has been heading procurement.",

A Generation where a woman prefers to pack her belongings from her husband's house back to her parents house rather than say, I AM SORRY! A Generation where a man prefers to loose his marriage and keep his ego. Welcome to the Generation where everyone is right. A generation that never accepts to be wrong, a generation that knows it all. A Generation that so much prides itself yet is full of ignorance of diplomatic ways to tolerating one another. A Generation that prefers to argue for years rather than spilling out the word, I AM SORRY !!! Welcome to the Generation of faults shifting. A Generation that claims right at all times and seek to judge others. A Generation that only sees the bad in others and nothing bad about themselves. A Generation that prefers to argue endlessly instead of saying, I AM SORRY! Welcome to the Generation that celebrate selfishness. A Generation that wants people to always apologize to them. A Generation of self respect, they prefer to move on rather than sort out things with their partners and friends! Generation that will rather part ways with the friends and divine helpers than say AM SORRY LETS FORGET MY WRONG DOING . A Generation so full of themselves. A Generation that feels too big to say, I AM SORRY!! Listen to the news and see how many people are stabbing their partners to death, marriage has crashed and once happy homes now become slaughter grounds all because we feel it is not worth saying, I AM SORRY !!! Can you do me a favour by pronouncing, ""I AM SORRY"" How did you feel when you pronounced it? Did your name change? Did your skin colour or height change? Did you lose your wig or make up it? Did your Bank credit deplete when you said it? Did your blood reduce when you said it? Or did you contact covid19 when you said it! Hmm, so why do you prefer to loose that beautiful lady/handsome guy because of pride? Why do you prefer to lose that wonderful relationship, friendship and spiritual helper that God has given you . Remember, pride goes before a fall. Some of us have lost our real spouses because it is hard for us to say, I AM SORRY... Do you know ""A SORRY CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER"" Just say it countless time ok And trust me nothing bad will happen when you say it rather there will be RECONCILIATION. There will be peace and happiness again. Friendship will be restored and amazing things will start happening again. I AM SORRY IF THIS TEXT OFFENDS YOU. #peaceandlove",

56922,347047455399759,"I'M CRYING FOR HÀJJI NASSER SSEBAGALA Hajji Nasser Ssebagala was one of the highly respected person in the National, City and DP politics. True he had gaps in his education but apart from having a challenge addressing people in English, you would find alot of sense and wisdom in his proposals to fix the problems of Uganda. Nasser Ssebagala was the originator of the new brand of the poor man's politics and a promise of a country we're each person can afford the basic needs of life exemplified by carrying ""Akaveera"" back home at the close of the day. Hajji Ssebagala did earn the Mayorship to defeat polished contenders like Wasswa Biriggwa. On the other hand Ugandans in their usual style loved him without question. They tolorated his excesses in that even when he got arrested over dealing in fake currency that made him Persona non grata in United States of America, the people stood by him. That is Hajji Nasser Ssebagala whom Ugandans by consesus considered one of the people who could be trusted with the Presidency. In DP there was a revolt against Ssemogerere as members pressurised him to hand over the party leadership to a youthful Ssebagala whose other credential was that of being a Moslem in a period when DP was rebranding and wanted to deal away with the perception that it was a party for Catholics. Around that period any politician especially here in Buganda had to be near Nasser Ssebagala to boost his/her electrol chances. Nasser Ssebagala in the early 2000s was the influencer of opposition politics and I and Erias Lukwago almost got political executed for keeping camp with the ""oldmen led by Ssemogerere"" and this,we were accused...was because we were "" envious of Ssebagala"". People would question Lukwago on why is was not being seen that he supports a fellow Muganda and Muslim? Then Hajji Ssebagala started climbing down...His first public display of switching camps was the day he drove around the City in Mr.Museveni's car and after that trip he has never been the same. The loved and respected Ssebaggala "" Hajji Alagidde"" died off and slowly through serving Mr.Museveni, Hajji Nasser Ssebagala gradually become a ""Political clown"". This is one of the areas where Mr.Museveni has killed off leaders on our side. He ( Museveni) mastered the strategy of denying leadership to masses opposed to him. Museveni knows that however much Ugandans are fed up with his regime, even when they are the majolity, they can never be able to cause a revolution without a credible leadership...For there has never been a leaderless revolution. So, he ( Museveni) targets for compromise individual opposition leaders. He draws them against the people...Everytime we lose a leader we have been dismissing and understating the loss....We console ourselves that he/she has gone alone. We laugh at them, thinking that they are suffering with shame. The fact of the matter is that the leadership gaps created by these defections eventually weaken us as forces of change. I propose that this is one area we should invest in so as to come up with a strategy to deal with the issue of defections of leaders. My brother Kyanjo once said, "" Ngeenda kusonyiwa Museveni ebintu ebirala byonna,naye sirimusonyiwa musango gw'okugwagwawaza abagezi baffe"".",

62323,274577061337,"HOW THE WORD ""GAY"" LOST IT'S ORIGINAL MEANING AND ACQUIRED A NEW ONE. The word gay arrived in the English language in the 12th century, adopted from the French word ""Gai"". Its origin is thought to be German. In English, the word meant "" joyful, carefree, bright and showy"". In the 19th century, the meaning of the word started to change to mean immorality, particularly referring to women who were prostitutes and men who slept with many women, usually prostitutes. In 1950 the meaning of the word was officially recognised to mean ""Homosexuals"". It has gradually lost its original meaning, but it is still grammatically correct and is in cultural use as the Christian name or surname ""GAY"" demonstrates. Please note the changes above never involved black people or Africans.",

Courtesy photo. https://bit.ly/corona-TND By James William Mugeni USA—26, June 2020: President Museveni in your recent address you assured us that Uganda has managed to survive in the Covid-19 period without external support. You told us that Uganda has everything that makes white’s laugh at us why we are in a predicament and wonder what is wrong with us. You said we were enslaved 600 years ago, and it is time for you to remove us from slavery. You mocked whites who were part of the audience to a thunderous clapping from those who listened to you. President, we are enslaved to the extent that the audience you address allows to be misinformed, which is another form of slavery and self-denial. Just for this Covid-19 period government of Uganda has depended heavily on US government for almost all sectors. Below are extracts from the US-Embassy as posted on their Facebook page showing the amount of money that the US-Embassy has given to Uganda during the Covid -19. President your distorted narrative of the help US government gives to Uganda cannot go without challenge especially for some of us who have worked with the US government within Uganda as Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Uganda does not almost subscribe to WHO but heavily to CDC. For Covid-19, the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) which is our Government of Uganda research institution has revealed that it has not received any Covid-19 related fundings from government and was forced to divert a sum of 780 million meant for other programs to facilitate the Covid-19 activities. UVRI has been in partnership with the U.S. government for over 30 years and is on the direct funding from USA! UVRI’s laboratories, with support from several U.S. government agencies over the years, are the backbone of Uganda’s successful Covid-19 response. UVRI routinely engages in health research pertaining to human infections and disease processes linked to viral aetiology, provides expert advice to Ministry of Health – Uganda, and serves as a centre for training and education. The U.S. government, through CDC, USAID – US Agency for International Development, The U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and National Institutes of Health (NIH), provides more than $2 million in support annually to the UVRI arbovirus lab, the viral haemorrhagic fever lab, the Uganda Sample Transport Network, and for continued operation of the National Influenza Center, the main lab being used for Covid-19 testing. The U.S. has contributed an additional $400,000 in Covid-19 to UVRI. This support funding was provided for performance evaluations on new test kits, increase support to staff, training, and the expansion of the severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) sentinel surveillance network. This donation represents another critical piece of assistance provided by the U.S. government to help Uganda’s Covid-19 response. Professor Pontiano Kaleebu, the Director, Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) had this to say recently: “We have worked with CDC in areas of HIV, in areas of emerging and re-emerging infections, and in the areas of Influenza. We are doing a study that is looking at long acting PrEP funded by USAID – US Agency for International Development through International Aids Vaccine Initiative, training, and building infrastructure capacity, so, CDC has been one of the major supporters but also other U.S. government agencies beyond the CDC.” “It’s very important and people may not know this, the vaccines that we get for EPI, for polio, for measles, when they are imported to the country our departments need to check that these vaccines are working well. We are in the period of trying to eradicate measles and polio and we check to find out whether we have measles or polio cases within our population, which is very important. Surveillance, we do a lot of surveillance, in communities to look for new infections. In HIV, we have done quite a lot with the support of our partners”. To date, the US has provided both technical assistance and more than $15 million—or Ugx 56 Billion—in funding to meet the urgent needs of Uganda’s Covid-19 response. The Uganda Virus Research Institute, with support from the U.S. government, has been identified as a Center of Excellency in Covid-19 diagnostics by Africa CDC. It is this lab that has provided all the data and all the information on the new infections we are getting. The U.S. government, through CDC, USAID – US Agency for International Development, and The U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), proudly supports Uganda’s Ministry of Health in protecting Uganda’s borders from infectious diseases like Covid-19. Uganda has done an (truncated)",

People Power Should Proceed With The Scientific Elections With Caution In Order To Legitimize U.F.D.F. Military Intervention To Prevent A Genocide By NRM? People Power Should Know That The Scientific General Elections That Is Forced On Ugandans By The Ruling NRM Is Already Reason # 1 Of The Main Triggers For Military Intervention By The U.F.D.F. Which Means Military Force To Remove Yoweri Museveni Is Inevitable Given The Circumstances On The Ground. So, Please, What Ever You Do Be Very Careful To Preserve Your Initial Victory. That Means The Mandate For The NRM Government Runs from February 2016 to February 2021. Okuva February 2021, FFE Tusalawo! At The Same Time, The U.F.D.F.

65452,274577061337,"Am seeing two or more things in Andrew Karamagi's narrative. I think this man called Yoweri Kaguta Museveni is either a super human or some Africans are naturally jealous. Actually to some extent I think Africans should stop thinking that because one has been awarded many degrees sijuyi are Doctors/Proffessors etc makes them special or changes what they are. Writing or speaking good English, acquiring skills and knowledge from those prestigious universities will not turn you into zungus that everything done in their countries is automatically applicable here. Who is this man Museveni, what was he made of that can fool these highly educated men and women for all this long (34/40 years)? What is more interesting is that those presumed to be wise because fell out with their boss wakina KB, Kawanga and others have for many years unsuccessfully fought tooth and nail to bring Museveni down. I can bet here that Mr Museveni will still be in State House for another term should he decide to contest in the next general elections. I have on several occasions heard or read things like Museveni is not a Ugandan and because of this fact doesn't love his country. Others naively or out of jealous say he did not even complete university but we all know was at Dar es salaam University and studied political science.",
